## Welcome

First and foremost, Welcome! :tada:

Thank you for visiting the SwipesForScience app documentation.

### We need citizen science

* Big data in biomedical research needs individual inspection :eyes:, but this doesn’t scale for large datasets.
* For example, some researchers analyze a large number of MRI images to study the brain.
  * But before they start the analysis, they have to visually inspect :eyes: each 🧠 image to make sure it is good quality.
  * And at various stages in data processing, researchers have to check :eyes: images to make sure the analysis is correct.
  * This can get really unweildy when we have large datasets, which are needed to really understand the brain. 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠
  * Our first prototype, [braindr.us](https://braindr.us) demonstrated how citizen science combined with deep learning can help us perform big data research at scale. To read more, head over to [results.braindr.us](http://results.braindr.us)
* Citizen science games like [EyeWire](eyewire.org) have been really successful for brain analysis, but it is built for one specific type of data, and its really hard to adapt for a different use-case.
* Researchers 👩‍🔬 need a way to *easily* spin up a citizen science game for their own large datasets, ideally without needing to know web-development (so they can focus on research!)

### Launching your own citizen science project should be easy

The SwipesForScience game template will:

* Generate a game from a configuration file provided by a researcher 👩‍🔬
* The game should be easy to deploy online, and require very little knowledge of web technologies/cloud ☁️ technologies
* Be fun and easy for citizen scientists to use ❤️
